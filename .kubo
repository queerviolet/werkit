@[Workshop] Kubo
  @[Concept] Introduction
    Kubo is a little program that serves up interactive documentation.

    @[Action] Quick start
    To run the kubo for a repository, the recipe is simple:

      @[Code] sh
      kubo

    That'll start the server and open a browser pointing at it.

    The server supports hot loading, so you can see changes to the workshop
    as you make them.
    
    @[Action] If you...
    Don't want to open the browser automatically?

      @[Code] sh
      kubo -w
    
    Want to launch docs from a specific place?

      @[Code] sh
      kubo ${path_to_docs}

    Want to run the server on a specific port?

      @[Code] sh
      kubo -p ${port}

    Note that kubo currently always tries to find a port. If you do,

      @[Code] sh
      kubo -p 1234
    
    And port 1234 is in use, it'll try 1235, 1236, and so on.
    
    @[Action] What's going on?
    When you run kubo without a path, it looks for documentation:

      1. First it looks for a `kubo` entry in `package.json`.
         If such an entry exists, it uses it as the documentation module.
      2. If there's no `kubo` in `package.json`, it tries to import
         `.kubo` from the root of the package.
    
    If it can't find docs anywhere, kubo quietly exits to hang its head
    in shame.

  @[Concept] Theming Kubo
    
    Kubo themes are just a mapping of a tag name (like "Concept") to a
    module that `export default`s a React Component.

    @[Action] Using a theme    
    Kubo comes bundled with a theme that gives you `Workshop`, `Concept`,
    `Action`, `Hint`, and `Guide` components. You can override these
    or add new ones by specifying a theme.

    Currently, the only way to do this is on the command line:

      @[Code] sh
      kubo -t ./path/to/theme -t some-theme-module
    
    Note that these args follow the path specification of Node modules. If
    you want to reference a theme from your current dir, you need to use
    an explicitly relative path (like this: `./some-theme`).
    
    You'll soon be able to specify these in `package.json`.

    @[Action] Writing a theme

    Themes are just modules that export an Object mapping component names
    to module names. Here's a theme:

      @[Code] json
      {
        "SnazzyComponent": "./components/Snazzy"
      }
    
    That's `json`, but you can also use `js`:

      @[Code] js
      module.exports = {
        SnazzyComponent: "./components/Snazzy",
      }
    
    Note that themes are *not* currently run through webpack, so you must
    use `module.exports`. You also can't specify actual Component classes—
    you must specify modules.

    This will change.

  @[Concept] mmmmmmmmmm
    @[Action] Many minor matters
      Kubo comes bundled with the [many minor matters](#many-minor-matters)
      loader to make writing this documentation easier. You don't have to use it;
      Kubo is agnostic to how the components it loads are specified.

      But it *is* very nice. I'm using it now and I love it!
