Now let's repeat what we did in the last task, but this time on Stack Overflow.

Go into your Developer Story on Stack Overflow, then add the 3 projects that you built during Senior Phase to your timeline (Grace Shopper, Stackathon and Capstone) as well as your Tech Talk. 

Make sure to add your 3 videos as well.

And make sure to add any blog posts that you may have written recently.

(then mark this task as complete!)

<script>
$(document).ready(function () {
  var actionId = angular.element('#checks').scope().action._id;
  function _getCheck (n) {
    var stored = localStorage.getItem(actionId + '_checkmark_' + n);
    if (!stored) return false;
    return stored == 'complete' ? true : false;
  }
  function _setCheck (n, bool) {
    var toStore;
    if (bool) toStore = 'complete';
    else toStore = 'incomplete';
    localStorage.setItem(actionId + '_checkmark_' + n, toStore);
  }
  $('[type="checkbox"]')
  .each(function (idx, elem) {
    var $elem = $(elem);
    $elem.prop('checked', _getCheck(idx));
    $elem.on('change', function () {
      _setCheck(idx, $elem.prop('checked'));
    });
  });
