Hey Fullstackers!

You're about to move into the Senior Phase of the immersive program, which will be an exciting (and fast-paced) time for you. 

This is when you'll go into "maker mode", and start applying the skills you've just learned to build some amazing projects.  

You'll also start thinking about life *after* Fullstack, and what type of job you'll accept after you graduate.  

You'll work through this workshop during your Senior Phase, so that you're in a strong position to land your dream job as a software engineer.

You'll be working closely with Fullstack's _Career Success Team_ as you make your way through this workshop. The team's goals are:

- Help you get a job that you love!
- Prep you for the job hunt, and make sure you get the best positions (and offers) possible 
- Give you all the help and guidance you need during your time in the Senior Phase, and after you graduate (in one-on-one meetings, via video chat, and via Slack)
- Help you increase your engagement with the Fullstack alumni network

Ready to see how the Career Success Program works?  Let's go!
