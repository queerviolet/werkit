This week, we're going to do some more preparation for your upcoming job interviews.

Let's first summarize how interviews usually go:

__Phone screen__

A recruiter will usually start by telling you a little bit about their company, their culture, and the particular role.  He or she will ask about your background, and why you're interested in this role and their company. [Here's a list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KC4weMKRfgvBTaPQxUodqOqSdJ1ZSjqwEuTmA_3ANmQ/edit?usp=sharing) of other questions that are commonly asked during phone screens.

The recruiter will probably ask you some basic technical questions, like "what's your favorite Javascript library, and why"? 

At the end of the conversation, he or she will ask you if you have any questions.  Make sure you have already prepared at least three questions!  [Here's a list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jzPhFDTlzuujYuwhZpqcrPH_mXzAiqx9t6K3vLDl9e8/edit?usp=sharing) of possible questions that you could ask.

__Take-home coding challenges__

The next step is often a set of coding challenges. They might be timed (e.g. complete them by the end of the week).  If they are timed, make sure to ask for the company to send them when you've got an open day to work on them.

__On-site interview__

You can have any where from 3-7 hours of interviewing for a particular role.  The interviews could include technical challenges like:

- solving coding challenges on a white board
- solving basic mathematical questions
- solving theoretical questions
- answering technology-related questions

Make sure you are not caught off guard by these questions!  __At this point, you should start carving out at least one hour per day to study for technical challenges.__  Here are some great resources for doing just that:
