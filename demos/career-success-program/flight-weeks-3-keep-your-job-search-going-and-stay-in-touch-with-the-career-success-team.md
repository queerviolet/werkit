At this point, your job search "machine" is properly up and running.

Remember what we said about "perseverance" at the beginning of Flight?  Keep that in mind!  

Stay focused and diligent, getting in 3-5 applications per day, and preparing for your interviews. 

And above all, stay confident!  __You have in-demand coding skills that employers need, and want.__

And if you get turned down for a job, don't get too bummed out about it.  [It happens to everyone...even some of the best developers in the world!](http://rejected.us/)
