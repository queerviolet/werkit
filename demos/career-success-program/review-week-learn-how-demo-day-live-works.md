_Demo Day Live_ is the marquee event at Fullstack and Grace Hopper, where we get a chance to showcase our super-talented Seniors, and the work they have been doing.  

It's a live video broadcast on Facebook Live...think of it as like "Sportscenter for code".  But instead of being about athletes, it's about coders. The best way to get a feeling for it is to see an example:

For _Demo Day Live_, we pull together all 3 of our campuses into the same live event, which showcases the all-around awesomeness of the Fullstack community.  This is how it works:

The live audience for each event includes:

- IN NYC: presenting teams from FS NYC and Grace Hopper (and their instructors and fellows) are in the audience in Hamilton Hall (while the NYC teams are presenting)
- IN CHICAGO: presenting teams from FS Chicago (and their instructors and fellows) are in the audience in 1871 (while the Chicago teams are presenting)
- ONLINE: The audience that's watching the livestream on Facebook Live includes people that we have invited to attend (e.g.  alumni, friends & family of presenting students, hiring partners, and members of the "general public" who may find us on Facebook).

**The schedule**

On the morning of _Demo Day Live_, there is a full dress rehearsal (from 10:30 AM to 1:00 PM EST) where all teams present.  Call time for the dress rehearsal is 10:20 AM EST.

The actual _Demo Day Live_ broadcast starts at 3:30 PM EST, and runs until 5:30 PM EST.  It is actually the first event in 4 days of activities related to Hiring Day, as you can see here:

**Publishing the videos to employers**

We publish all the video replays in a blog post by 9 PM of Demo Day, then invite employers to watch them before Hiring Day happens three days later.  The blog post looks like this:

Each student's _Demo Day Live_ presentation video is also published in their respective Hiring Day Profile.
