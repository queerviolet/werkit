Now we need to deal with the local state of this form as well - we'll want to control the selected value on state, have an `onChange` listener...this is all sounding very familiar. You'll also want to fetch a list of all songs from the server to show in the list of options.

We're almost at the end, so training wheels are off! This is a pretty challenging exercise, but don't worry - you've got this. Write a help ticket if you get stuck!

Good luck!

Clicking the add song button adds the selected song to the playlist in the database
The new song renders into the song list immediately
You are still able to play/pause the songs in the song list and they interact appropriately with the player
