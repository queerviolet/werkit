Try your hand at implementing some of these other commands.  

## sort filename.txt

Return the file sorted lexicographically by line.

## wc filename.txt

The Unix `wc` prints newline, word, and byte counts for a file. Yours may simply return the number of lines.

## uniq filename.txt

If a line in a file is the same as the line above it, remove it from the output. A file that's sorted and then `uniq`ed is guaranteed to not have any duplicate lines.
