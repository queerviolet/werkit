Node.js is a tool that allows us to execute **machine processes** in Javascript. 

Before Node's release, Javascript had been confined mostly to the browser, only able to execute programs and logic in a browser environment that has many restrictions and limited capabilities for interacting with a client machine.

With Node, we are able to run programs written in Javascript that interact with a machine. Node has access to low-level components, such as file systems, operating system properties, and the network.
