This workshop will have you implement common [`bash`](http://bit.ly/1ikp2Hl) (a.k.a. terminal) commands using Node.js. Due to Node's ability to access low-level system information and utility, we can mimic many terminal operations â€” totally impossible to do in the browser!

You will learn basic Node concepts like the built-in globals, [Node.js module system](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_modules), how to use built-in modules, creating your own modules and using [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) for third-party modules.

Also, in the process of writing your own shell, you'll discover two things, that your terminal Bash shell is a programming environment and it's powered by _The Unix Philosophy_, the idea that you should create small programs that can interoperate with each other.

You will also learn the blessings and tribulations of an asynchronous platform and how to compose and manage parallel operations that could complete at any time!

## Power Tools

Two powertools you'll need during this are:

1.  `man` - bash's `man`ual pages.  In your terminal, if you're ever confused by what a command `cmd` means, type `man cmd`.  
2.  [explainshell.com](http://explainshell.com/) - a very nice wrapper around `man` pages, just type in a command and it'll explain to you all the steps in that command.
