## Install StackChat 2 Start

If you have not yet forked https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/stackchat, then please do so now.

Clone it again into a new repo like so: `git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/stackchat --branch day2-starting`, and then `npm install` (or `yarn install`) again. This will set up a new repo with the day 2 starting code.

We recommend that you branch off from this starting point branch (for example, you could create and checkout a new branch called "day2" by typing: `git checkout -b day2`) and work off from that branch instead of "master".
