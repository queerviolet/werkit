Something that might be bugging you is how big the `switch` statement within our `reducer` has gotten. It's bugging me too - fortunately, `redux` offers us a utility function that we can use to break up our one big reducer into many smaller "sub-reducers".

If you haven't yet (or even if you have), check out the [Redux docs for combineReducers](http://redux.js.org/docs/api/combineReducers.html)

When you feel comfortable with what `combineReducers` does, move on and we'll use it to refactor our Redux code!
