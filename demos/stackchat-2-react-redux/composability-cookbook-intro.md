The following sections are **not necessary** to complete this workshop.

They are bonus readings that go over several advanced concepts, and are meant to be a reference as you continue your React journey. You may wish to read them now, or at some point in the future. They contain some thoughts (*including some opinions*) on how to take advantage of React's functional architecture to write components that are modular and DRY.

I hope you enjoy them and return to them every so often!
