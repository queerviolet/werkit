# Pro Pair Programming

We want you to begin practicing [pair programming](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/pairing/). Pair programming is not only a common industry tool, but also a great way to learn software development. While you work on these Data Structures, be sure to:

* Follow the driver-navigator role split
* Exchange roles regularly
* Take note of techniques or tricks your partner may know
* Discuss and question your approaches productively
* Respect your partner's inputs and efforts
* Have fun!
