If you have implemented the Linked List data structure with time to spare, you should now go back to your Queue ADT solution and *re-implement* it using a linked list.

1. Copy your LL solution into a new `ll.js` file in the queue folder
2. Comment out your current queue solution
3. Write a Queue solution that uses your LL, instead of an array

Note that the same spec (queue) has been solved using two very different solutions. This gets at the heart of the distinction between an ADT and a DS — the former is what we want, the latter is how we accomplish it. It is very often the case that a given ADT has several competing DS implementations, each with pros and cons. A good programmer will select the best DS for their use case.

Discuss with your pair partner the pros & cons of using a linked list vs a fixed array to implement the queue ADT. You may look at the lecture slides for reference.
